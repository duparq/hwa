Introducing HWA	{#mainpage}
===============

HWA <sup>(*)</sup> (HardWare Abstractor) is a hardware abstraction layer implemented at the
compiling phase for programming microcontrollers in C. A few features of HWA
are useful for programming in assembler too.

By providing a set of generic instructions hiding the details of the actual
hardware organization, HWA allows the programmer to write source code that is
easier to read, easier to maintain, and easier to port between targets.

HWA uses a cache mechanism that with the help of the compiler's optimization
algorithms make it produce a machine code free of any penalty, either in terms
of size, execution speed or memory used.
