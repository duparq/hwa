Swuart is a software UART for 1 or 2-wire communications.

Swuart can work by software only without interrupt or with an 8 or 16-bit
timer-counter. It can use any pin that can trigger an interrupt on a falling
edge (currently: INT0, AIN1, PCINT8).

Automatic baudrate detection is provided.

Swuart uses the HWA macros for hardware access.

Tested on ATtiny with internal oscillator at ~16 MHz (OSCCAL=0xFF):
 - 1..100 kbps with 16-bit timer not prescaled
 - 450 bps .. 50 kbps with 16-bit timer 1/8 prescaled
 - 100 kbps with 8-bit timer not prescaled
 - 10 kbps with 8-bit timer 1/8 prescaled

To be tested/rewritten: using an 8-bit timer with 16-bit software-extended compare match.
