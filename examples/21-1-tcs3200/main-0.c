/*	Drive a TCS3200 color detector
 *
 *	The timer used by the SWUART is also used to compute the frequency of
 *	the output signal of the TCS3200.
 *
 *	With S0= and S1= , frequency is in the range f0..12 kHz, so period is in
 *	the range 83..t0 Âµs.
 *
 *	With hw_syshz = 8 MHz, this gives periods >512 counter units so we can
 *	drop last 8 bits of counting.
 *
 *	"The output-scaling counter registers are cleared upon the next pulse of
 *	the principal frequency after any transition of the S0, S1, S2, S3, and
 *	OE lines.The output goes high upon the next subsequent pulse of the
 *	principal frequency, beginning a new valid period."
