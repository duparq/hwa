Atmel AVR8 Examples {#atmelavr8_examples}
===================

HWA comes with a bunch of example projects that demonstrate how to use it with
Atmel AVR devices. You'll find a list of all the examples <a
href="examples.html"><b>here</b></a>. 

The examples use predefined boards and target devices. These are described
@subpage atmelavr_boards "here".

The @subpage atmelavr_diabolo "Diabolo bootloader" is an example of using HWA
for assembler programming.
